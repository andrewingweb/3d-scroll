            For although a man is judged by his actions, by what he has said and
            done, a man judges himself by what he is willing to do, by what he
            might have said, or might have done â€“ a judgment that is necessarily
            hampered, not only by the scope and limits of his imagination, but
            by the ever-changing measure of his doubt and self-esteem.
